Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of both computer science and engineering which deals with developing, designing, building, testing and maintaining software.
Importance of Software Engineering.
1.It is reliable. Well structured software engineering practices creates a reliable and stable software. This reduces biasness, errors and system failures.
2.It encourages innovation. Through software engineering, we are able to create new applications, products and services which solve daily problems and improve our lives.
3.It is flexible.This ensures that the system can adapt to changing requirements and technologies and also grow with increasing demands.
4.It puts into consideration the security of data and privacy of users. It does this by implementing authentication, encryption and authorisation practices.
5.Quality Assurance. It is able to test, identify and address defects thus ensuring final products meets high standards.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Mastering complexity.
This is when the dominion of hardware over software came to an end and personal computers came. The software development process would now address analysis and design from the specification. Customers would look out for graphical user interface and visual programming from the different softwares.Data modelling and function modelling converged in object-oriented methods and was applied in the specification and analysis.
2.Mastering process.
While trying to reduce risk during development and improve quality and productivity, it led to the discovery of software engineering. The need to concentrate on predesign phases and using less formal models for software specification became dire. Software Requirement Engineering Methodology and the Structured Analysis and Design Technique were developed and hence the development of specification documents for business management software.
3.Mastering machine.
During this period, the only function of any software was to optimize the exploitation of the limited hardware resources. The first compilers were defined and operating systems were noninteractive and this led to the definition of the first low-level Computer Aided Software Engineering tools enabling interactive editing, compiling and debugging. 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirement Analysis.This is where stakeholders and developers collaborate to understand what the software should do.
2.Planning.This involves defining timelines, resources  and identifying potential risks in order to ensure smooth execution.
3.Design.This is where the developers create a framework  which shows how components like database design and user interface will interact.
4.Coding.The developers write the actual software based on the design and requirements.
5.Testing.The software is then tested to examine, find and fix bugs or glitches.
6.Deployment.After the software has been checked it is released to the users.
7.Maintenance.The software will require updates and testing to adapt to new requirements and maintain perfomance.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In Agile methodology, the developers start with simple design and then begin to work on small modules. After completion of a module, the developer tests for bugs and fixes it. While in Waterfall methodology, it involves discrete development stages where the steps are done in a sequential manner.Once a stp is completed , you can't go back to the previous step.
Agile is used:-When there is no clear picture of what the final product looks like.
              -When rapid production is more important than the quality of the product.
Waterfall is used:-When the client has complete knowledge of what they want.              


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
